## Hi there ðŸ‘‹



- ðŸ”­ Hello! My name is Kim zhyrelle Macabuhay Del Mundo, 18 years old and loves incorporating arts and designs in tech stuffs, i've always wanted to learn how to code and program that's why this course piqued my interest. I'm looking forward on learning more about matters relating to this field, and hoping it'll teach me lessons i would use in the future ^__^

  
- ðŸŒ± My goal is to learn, to be able to write code well and do fun projects that incorporates the things i've learned, It's tough to learn python as for last year i had trouble navigating the route of learning the subject, but hoping this semester i would learn well and do well this time, able to learn bunch of things that'll be useful for me.

  
- ðŸ‘¯ Skills: My main skill i would say is creativity, quick to think on fields like concepts, design and themes, I have a bit of knoweledge in html/css, Java and c#! Working on my back end skills.
